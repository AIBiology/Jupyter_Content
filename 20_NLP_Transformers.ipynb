    "# Transformers\n",
    "    \n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to try to make the links from NLP to the emergence of transformer architectures in NLP to set us up for looking at broader applications of transformers beyond NLP. We are trying not to get bogged down in the details of NLP or transformers, but I provide some intuition on how transformers revolutionized NLP and how they are now moving on to impact other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his [GTC 2022 Keynote](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote/), Nvidia's CEO, Jensen  Huang, stated:\n",
    "> The Transformer is unquestionably the most important deep learning model invented.\n",
    "\n",
    "That says a lot for an architecture introduced only 5-years earlier in 2017!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook largely follows and quotes from the [Hugging Face Transformer Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/3?fw=tf). It starts with some motivating examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of what Transformers can do in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up the cache directory and a note on containers\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the Huggingface `transformers` module will download things to `~/.chache/huggingface`. There are a couple of problems with that. First, our home directories are limited in size. Second, it can take a while to download the first time you run. The transformers module uses the `HF_HOME` and `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` environment variables to define where its downloads should go. \n",
    "\n",
    "The path here looks a bit odd...`/bsc4892/share/huggingface/`! Why isn't that `/lustre/fs0/bsc4892`? The reason is that the `NeMo NLP` kernel is running in an [Apptainer container](https://apptainer.org/). Paths outside the container are *bind mounted* into the container, and `/luster/fs0/bsc4892` was mounted as `/bsc4892` in the container. Therefore, that is the path we need to use. "

    "> We’ll start by tackling a more challenging task where we need to classify texts that haven’t been labelled. This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don’t have to rely on the labels of the pre-trained model. You’ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."

This means they have been trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion. **Self-supervised learning is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This type of model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on, but it’s not very useful for specific practical tasks. Because of this, the general pre-trained model then goes through a process called transfer learning. During this process, the model is fine-tuned in a supervised way — that is, using human-annotated labels — on a given task.\n",

    "## Attention layers\n",
    "\n",
    "> A key feature of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called attention layers. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was [\"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)! ...for now, all you need to know is that this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To put this into context, consider the task of translating text from English to French. Given the input “You like this course”, a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word “You” to get the proper translation for the word “like”, because in French the verb “like” is conjugated differently depending on the subject. The rest of the sentence, however, is not useful for the translation of that word. In the same vein, when translating “this” the model will also need to pay attention to the word “course”, because “this” translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of “this”. With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Now that you have an idea of what attention layers are all about, let’s take a closer look at the Transformer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The original architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. During training, the **encoder** receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the **decoder** receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The original Transformer architecture looked like this, with the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture of a Transformers models](images/transformers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the the first attention layer in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layer uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The attention mask can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words — for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences.\n",
