    "# From neuron to neural net\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time, we looked at a single neuron. We discussed the parallels between that neuron with two weights and linear regression. As we add more features (columns in our X matrix) we can add more neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as we add neurons, each neuron is still mostly functioning like linear regression. The next thing we can add to our neuron is an **activation function**. Activation functions adjust the output of a neuron by adding some function before the final output. Below are the \"linear\" activation function that we have modeled so far, plus the more common **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** and **Sigmoid** activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagrams of the linear, ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions](images/Activation_function_diagrams.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the activation function is applied to the output of a neuron and is a hyperparameter of the model. In practice, while layers may use different activation functions, the same function is applied to **all neurons** of each layer. Below is a single neuron, with the a couple possible activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of a neuron with activation function](images/Activation_function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "As we get multiple neurons, we need some way of coordinating their output, so we can add a layer to gather the output from multiple neurons into the needed number of outputs (more on that later). But the other thing that layers do is allow deeper networks with multiple layers, each selected for functional or empirical reasons. This is where deep learning gets its name--as networks grow to have more and more layers of neurons, we refer to them as deep networks--there is no agreed upon cutoff here...more than three???\n",
