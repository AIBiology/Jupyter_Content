The image below shows common computer vision tasks and is from [Shivani Kolungade](https://medium.com/@kolungade.s/object-detection-image-classification-and-semantic-segmentation-using-aws-sagemaker-e1f768c8f57d)\n",

    "For this exercise, we will explore image classification, starting with a \"simple\" neural network and then adding convolutional layers, data augmentation and more to build better models.\n",

    "The American Sign Language [manual alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_manual_alphabet) has signs for each letter. We will skip J and Z because those signs require motion. \n",

    "The dataset we'll use is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjaiswal/sign-mnist-using-cnn/data). There should be 24 classes...but for some reason, there are 25...We'll stick with the Kaggle data, but keep this in mind...\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with this dataset because it helps with the transition from the tabular data we've been working with to image data. Images are a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a brightness. For greyscale images, there is one grid, for color images, there are typically three grids, for the red, green and blue colors (RGB), often called color channels.\n",
